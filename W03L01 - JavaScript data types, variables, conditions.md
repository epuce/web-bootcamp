## JavaScript
    JavaScript is the brain behind most of web page actions, usability, visual transformation, interaction
### JS console
    Browsers DevTools part that allows to communicate with the browser, web page, debug or test your code 
### Data types
All data types have their built in functions to convert them to a different type or some conditional possibilities (looping, getting some descriptive values, etc.)
* String - any text that is defined as one, usually set a characters between "" or ''; 

```JavaScript
var example = "This is a string";
```

* Number - integer of float type, positive or negative; 

```JavaScript
var example = 3.14;
```

* Array - data collection placed in a list
    * the data specified in the list can be any type
    * It's defined as any data between [] and separated with a comma
    * The data is tracked by index, where the first one is 0

```JavaScript
var example = ['test', true, [1, 2, 3], null];
```

* Object - same as array, only the index is specified
    * The data sets is a key -> value sequence 
    * It's defined as the key -> value pairs between {}

```JavaScript
var example = {key: "value", test: 123, another_object: {name: "Ed"}};
```

* Function - not a static value, but an action group that executes some activities that return a value (if no return value stated, it is treated ad undefined). There can be defined or anonymous functions. 

```JavaScript
// Function with a variable reference to it
function sayHello() { 
    alert("Hello");
}

// Anonymous function
function() { 
    console.log("Im anonymous");
}
```

* Boolean - describes positive (true) or negative (false) value (condition)
    * There are values that also are treated as true or false
        * falsely - 0, '' (empty string), null, undefined, NaN
        * truly - not empty strings, all numbers except zero, arrays, objects, functions, etc.

```JavaScript
var example = true;
```

* null, undefined, NaN - depending on the use all these values ar treated as false, so then what's the difference?
    * null - always stated as a non existing value from the user, or just a fallback if nothing assigned
    ```JavaScript
    let test = null;
    ```
    * undefined - the variable has been stated, but no value has been assigned;
    ```JavaScript
    let test;
    console.log(test) // Logs undefined to the console
    ```
    * NaN - Not-A-Number, this is set when a mathematical action has to be performed but he passed values can't be used 
    ```JavaScript
    "string" * 10 // This actions returned value is NaN
    ```

### Variables
* var - old variable declaration (before ES6 standard introduction), can be accessed depending on the scope it was declared. Can be overwritten in a lower level scope

```JavaScript
var name = "Ed";

function newFunction() {
    var gender = "male";

    console.log(gender); // logs "male" to the console
}

console.log(gender); // gender not defined

var name = "Alex";
name = "Jim";
```

* let - blok (scope) level declaration, can't be re-declared on the same level, does not interfere with other block levels

```JavaScript
let name = "Ed";

function newFunction() {
    let  gender = "male";

    console.log(gender); // logs "male" to the console
}

console.log(gender); // gender not defined

let name = "Alex"; // ERROR
name = "Jim";

function newFunction() {
    let  name = "male"; // re-declared in a different scope
}
```

* const - can't be updated or re-declared

``` JavaScript
const name = "Ed";
name = "Jim"; // Error, already declared

const person = {
    name: "Ed",
    gender: "male"
}

person.name = "Alex"
```
1. **var** declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while **let** and **const** are block scoped.

2. **var** variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; **let** variables can be updated but not re-declared; **const** variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.

3. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while **var** variables are initialized with **undefined**, **let** and **const** variables are not initialized.

4. While **var** and **let** can be declared without being initialized, **const** must be initialized during declaration.

### Checkup
1. Create a variable and assign a **string** to it
2. Create a variable and assign a **number** to it
3. Create a variable and assign a **boolean** to it
4. Create a variable and assign a **array** with 5 different items in it
5. Create a variable and assign a **object** with 2 other objects in it
6. Create a declared and an anonymous **function**
    * one returns undefined
    * other one return NaN
7. Create a function that overwrites a constant variables object value based on the variable that's passed to the function

```JavaScript
// How to test
console.log(typeof variable) // logs the type of the variable to the console

// Example
console.log(typeof Math.PI) // logs "number" to the console
```
 
 ### Conditions

* if/else is/else
```JavaScript
if (true) {
    // Run this code if the condition is tru
} else if (true) {
    // Run this code if the first is false and the second is true
} else {
    // Run this in any other case when the first two are falss
}

// Shorthand for if/else
true ? "If true, execute this code" : "If false, execute this code";

// One line if statement with no {}
if (true) "Do something";
```

* switch
```JavaScript
switch(item) {
    case "this_value":
    // Do something
    break;
    case "other_value":
    // Do this
    break;
    default:
    // Do this if no exact item
    break;
}
```

* AND / OR / reverse conditioning / comparison
```JavaScript
// comparison (strict)
true === true // Yes (true); === tests if values and data types are equal
true !== true // No (false); !== tests if values and data types are not equal

// comparison (not-strict)
true == true // Yes (true); == tests if values are equal
true == "true" // No (false);
100 == "100" // Yes (true)es;

// number1 > number1
100 > 90 // Yes (true); > tests if one number is bigger than the other
// number1 <= number1
90 <= 90 // Yes (true); <= or >= tests if on number is bigger or the same as the other one

// AND statement: &&
true && true // Yes (true)
true && false // No (false)
false && false // No (false)

// OR statement: ||
true || true // Yes (true)
true || false // Yes (true)
false || false // No (false)

// reverse conditioning
!true // No (false)
!false // Yes (true)
!(10 > 0 && 10 < 15) //No (false); the inner is true && true === true and then we reverse the true result and get false in the end
```
