### Create  a todo list
1. Create a page where we show a input field where we can add a to-do item
2. When submitted the item is shown in a list under the input
3. Before the item, there is a checkbox, when checked - the item goes to a second list under the first one. This action can be reversed.
4. Add the possibility to delete the items (from both lists)
5. Add the possibility to edit an existing item (from not checked list)

    ###Extra:

6. Allow to order the items in unchecked list
7. Add a login page and track the list based on the user
