### SQL database advanced
1. Joining tables
```sql
CREATE TABLE Purchases
    (
        purchase_time datetime,
        name varchar(20),
        id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        user_id int,
        PRIMARY KEY (id),
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(id)
    );
```

2. Getting joined data - join types [link](http://www.sql-join.com/sql-join-types)
```sql
SELECT u.name 
FROM Purchases as p INNER JOIN Users as u
ON p.user_id = u.id
```

3. Grouping and ordering

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Users as u
GROUP BY u.name
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Users as u
GROUP BY u.id DESC --- Possible values DESC | ASC
```

4. Join types

5. SQL functions
    * Mathematical - [link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mathematical-functions.html)
    * Logical
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Purchases AS p (user_id, name, purchase_time) VALUES
    SELECT u.id, "Product name", NOW() FROM Users AS u
    ```
6. Complex queries
```sql
SELECT
    s.status_id,
    s.status_name,
    s.color,
    s.module,
    s.modified_date
FROM statuses AS s

WHERE in_use = "1" AND module != ""

ORDER BY module, ordering, status_id
LIMIT 0,3
```
```sql
SELECT 
    u.*,
    u.name AS full_name,
    u.user_type AS category,
    u.pict AS user_picture,
    r.role_name AS userRole 
FROM users as u
LEFT JOIN roles as r on r.role_id = u.role_id
LEFT JOIN users_accounts AS ua ON (u.id = ua.user_id)
WHERE 1=1 
GROUP by u.id
ORDER BY name asc
LIMIT 0,3
```
```sql
SELECT p.project_id AS columnId, p.project_name AS columnName  
FROM projects AS p
RIGHT OUTER JOIN (
    SELECT
    cf.*, p.project_id AS colVal, p.project_name AS colSort, IFNULL(uo.id, 0) AS rowVal, uo.name AS rowSort , usr.initials AS owner_initials, usr.name AS owner_name 
    FROM custom_fields AS cf
    LEFT JOIN projects AS p ON (cf.c_module=p.project_id)
    LEFT JOIN users AS uo ON (cf.owner_id=uo.id) LEFT JOIN users AS usr ON (usr.id = cf.owner_id) 
    WHERE cf.is_deleted="0" AND cf.owner_id IN ('295','78','97') 
    ORDER BY cf.item_id asc
) AS cale ON (cale.c_module= p.project_id)
GROUP BY project_id
ORDER BY project_name;		
```
7. SQL data validation
    * When setting up data types and properties we create database validations, it means we can't save not valid data
    * It means that the whole row wont be saved
    * Examples:
        * ```sql
            CREATE TABLE countries
            (
                country_code char(3) NOT NULL,
            );
        
        * ```sql
            CREATE TABLE events
            (
                event_day ENUM ('Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat','Sun'),
            );
        * ```sql
            CREATE TABLE cars
            (
                min_range int, CHECK (min_range > 0)
            )

8. Wild card selectors
```sql
SELECT * FROM Purchases WHERE name LIKE 'computer%' --- Will select all rows that starts with computer
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com' --- Will select all rows that end with @gmail.com
```

### Checkup
Save all the scripts for further debugging
1. Crate a two tables and join them together
2. Populate both tables with at least 10 rows
3. Write the fallowing queries
    * retrieve data from table two based on table one
    * retrieve all data from both tables that belong to the primary key
    * retrieve only some columns from table number one and table number two based on a condition
4. Create a new table and write a function that populates the table based on some data from one of the first tables
5. Set up some data validation
